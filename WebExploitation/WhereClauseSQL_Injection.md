I first read up on the material related to  SQL injections which told about certain ways to perform an attack like ```'--``` which means that means that the rest of the query is interpreted as a comment, effectively removing it and ```'+OR+1=1--``` which causes to give all the items as 1=1 is always true. \
Using ```'--``` did not give any result so I used ```'+OR+1=1--``` which solved the challenge.
